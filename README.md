# NCMHap
This code is related to our recently proposed method called NCMHap. This method can solve single individual haplotype problem for diploid organisms.

NCMHap is free; you can redistribute it and/or modify it, to reconstruct haplotype sequences for diploid.

NCMHap will consider the Neutrosophic C-Means clustering algorithm, as a proposed solution to the haplotype reconstruction problem.

# Requirement:

This program is suitable for MATLAB R2014a and above versions. The program has adopted by Geraci's dataset. By some little change it can be used for any input data.


The main program for diploid case is NCMHap.m.

# The details of the used dataset can be accessible in the below paper:
