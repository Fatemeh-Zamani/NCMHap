# NCMHap

NCMHap is free; you can redistribute it and/or modify it, to reconstruct haplotype sequences for diploid.

NCMHap will consider the Neutrosophic C-Means clustering algorithm, as a proposed solution to the haplotype reconstruction problem.

# Requirement:

NCMHap is implemented in MATLAB R2014a and above versions.

The main program for diploid case is NCMHap.m.

For diploid case, We need Dr. F. Geraci simulated dataset (filippo.geraci@iit.cnr.it) that refer to his paper: Geraci, F., 2010. A comparison of several algorithms for the single individual SNP haplotyping reconstruction problem. Bioinformatics 26, 2217-2225.
